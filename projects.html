        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/LightcurveInversion">Light Curve Inversion</a></h3>
        <p>
        A python and C project aiming to reconstruct and identify 3D asteroid shapes only from their lightcurve graphs, inspired by "Rendezvous with Rama". Implements a simple raytracing algorithm and a DFF neural network.

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/ResonanceMeasurer">Material Resonance Measurer</a></h3>
        <p>
            A python program used to automate the collection of amplitude/frequency data and the resonance frequency of a sonic device using a laser Doppler vibrometer and a signal generator.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/NonuniformWaves">Wave Simulation in non-uniform Medium  </a></h3>
        <p>
            Simulates a 1D wave (on a string) using a discrete expression of the wave equation. The wave velocity along the string c(x) can vary to simualte a non-uniform medium (e.g varying string density). The wave is then analyzed using FFT and Hilbert transform for instantenous frequencies.

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank">Cellular Life Simulator</a></h3>
        <p>
            A simulator combining ideas from different cellular automata models - the classic Conway's (RIP) game of life and other variations such as "Lenia", a lesser known, but more generalized system of continuous cellular automata. (Link not up yet)
        </p>

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://idey.itch.io/exploit">Exploit (Game)</a></h3>
        <p>
            A short 2D platformer game about exploiting the mechanic that when you leave the screen from one end you return from the other end. Built in Godot.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/8080">8080 - Automatic Drum Machine</a></h3>
        <p>
            An automatic acoustic drumset, with multiple drums and dynamically changing BPM to match a musician. Built using Arduino.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/SSoF">Firefly Synchronization</a></h3>
        <p>
            A python model to study the factors affecting the synchronization of fireflies.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ilayws/Interpolation">Polynomial and Bezier Interpolation</a></h3>
        <p>
            A python project that takes n points as input and finds the bezier curve and the polynomial function for those n points. The polynomial is found by creating a system of equations, expressing them in matrix form, reducing to echilon form with gaussian elimination, then calculating the polynomial's coefficients. This method works very well for n < 11.
